# Pull Request Templates

Itâ€™s quite easy to generate a PR template for your project. Simply create a file named _PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE_ and place it one of three locations:

- The root of your project
- .github folder
- docs folder

Once GitHub detects the _PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE_ file, it will auto-populate new PRs with the contents.
